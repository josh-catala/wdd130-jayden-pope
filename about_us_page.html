            <p>Hi yall, I am Anubis the Guardian of the Dead. I am roughly 5100 years old.
                I am not the God of the dead contrary to popular belief. I guide the dead
                to the throne room of my boss, Osiris, where their heart is weighed against
                the Feather of Truth. If the feather is heavier than the feather, they are 
                good to go into the afterlife. But if the feather is lighter, the heart is 
                eaten and they get to wander the world eternally as a lost soul.
            </p>

            <p>Hey guys, I am Chac Mool, the God of rain, thunder, lightning, and storms. 
                I am known for my distinctive alters where I am laying down with a plate
                on my chest. This design is so my priests can set the beating heart of 
                the sacrifice on it as an offering.
